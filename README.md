# GSEA
Seperate repository for completing the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis/Overrepresentation Analysis for the first Chapter

## Details
In this repository, I will submit and update all of the code and results that I will generate for completing the GSEA and OrA for the first chapter. I think that having this section seperate will help with keeping everything organised and neat throughout the final stages of this analysis.

## Usage
The repository is only for use of myself (Hamish) and other members of the Evolutionary Ethology Lab (EEL) at the University of Aberdeen. Hamish is in charge of the repository, and has primary ownership, which include: all updates and changes to data and script, and must be contacted before pushing updates to the branch unless otherwise authorised.

## Navigation
The repository will contain several branches/folders: 
- **Data** - where all data is to be stored and organised based on usage and iteration;
- **R Scripts** - containing all of the R code scripts used throughout the analysis;
- **Results** - contains text and figure results from the analyses.
